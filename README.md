# **Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows**

📘 **Project Overview**
This project enhances the management of users, groups, and roles within the **ServiceNow** environment by implementing efficient **Access Controls (ACLs)** and automated **workflows**.
The goal is to ensure secure data handling, streamline task approvals, and optimize administrative operations through automation.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

* **Platform:** ServiceNow
* **Tools:** Flow Designer, Table Configuration, Access Control Lists (ACL)
* **Language:** JavaScript (for Business Rules)
* **Modules:** User Management, Task Table 2, Project Table NM

## 🧠 **Project Objective**

To automate and secure **user, group, and role management** by implementing **workflow-based approvals** and **access controls**.

The system ensures that:

* Only authorized users can update records.
* Workflow approvals (e.g., from a designated approver) are required for status changes.
* Task progress and completion are tracked automatically.


## 🧾 **Problem Statement**

Manual management of user access and task approvals often causes:

* Delayed task completions
* Unauthorized updates
* Inconsistent access control across roles

This project resolves these issues using **ServiceNow Flow Designer** to automate approvals and enforce **ACL-based data protection**.


## 📋 **Project Phases**

1. **Ideation Phase** – Problem identification and workflow planning
2. **Project Planning Phase** – Defining roles, groups, and table structures
3. **Project Design Phase** – Creating tables (Project Table NM, Task Table 2) and form layouts
4. **Requirement Analysis** – Defining triggers, status fields, and approval logic
5. **Performance Testing** – Validating flows, approvals, and data updates

## 💬 **Contributors**
